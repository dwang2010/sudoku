* small project idea!
  sudoku
  - object oriented
  - screen rendering
  - do it all in python3

* game details
  sudoku you have a board
  board is a 9x9 grid
  each "cell" of the grid can hold a number 1-9
  there are "regions" holding cells, that can be rows, columns or 3x3 blocks
  each section can only have unique values from 1-9 (no repeats)

** primary player actions
   - add numbers
   - remove numbers

** user interface
   left mouse click
   0-9 digit input

   tiles change color when selected by mouse
   tiles revert to base color following number entry, or new tile selection

   values 1-9 show up in black
   value 0 shows up as light grey
   locked numbers from pre-configured board show up in red, can't be selected

   message box at bottom of window
   - indicates game completion at end
   - "h" toggles hint printout (immediate check on board validity)

** TODO user interface
   "m" for manual board setup
   "s" to auto-solve the puzzle
